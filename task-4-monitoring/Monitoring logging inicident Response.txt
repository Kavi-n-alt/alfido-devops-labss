
### **Task 4 – Monitoring, Logging & Incident Response**



**Description:**  

Implemented monitoring, logging, and alerting for a containerized FastAPI 

application using Prometheus and Grafana.

Metrics are collected via Prometheus and visualized using Grafana dashboards.

Alert rules were configured to detect service downtime, and an incident response

runbook was prepared and tested.
